# GroundedLiving.org Update Summary

## Overview
- Migrated the CMS integration from Sanity to Prismic with new server-side query helpers and custom content types.
- Refreshed the blog, home, and about experiences with a soft Healing Soulfully-inspired Tailwind design, sticky navigation, and typography-powered article layouts.
- Added Prismic environment configuration, custom-type scaffolding, and documentation so non-technical editors can publish directly from Prismicâ€™s hosted UI.

## Tests
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`

All commands should pass before deployment.
