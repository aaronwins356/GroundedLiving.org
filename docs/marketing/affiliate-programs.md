# Affiliate Program Blueprint

Grounded Living integrates affiliate partners sparingly and transparently. The following programs are approved for phase-one monetisation and align with our ingredient and sourcing standards.

## Active Programs

| Partner | Focus | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Amazon Associates** | Books, small kitchen equipment, sleep tech | Use only for products we have tested; prefer single ASIN per recommendation to minimise reader overwhelm. |
| **Thrive Market** | Pantry staples, adaptogens, sustainable household goods | Link to curated collections; mention membership pricing and free-trial terms. |
| **Our Place** | Modular cookware for batch prepping | Highlight non-toxic materials and multi-use efficiency; perfect for breakfast blueprint emails. |
| **Mountain Rose Herbs** | Organic herbs and apothecary tools | Ideal for the herbal remedies magnet; include sourcing transparency snippet. |
| **Fullscript** | Professional-grade supplements (invite-only) | Leverage practitioner recommendations; remind readers to consult healthcare providers. |

## Disclosure Pattern

1. **Above-the-fold banner** on any affiliate-heavy post using `<AffiliateDisclosure />`.
2. **Inline context** before each recommendation (e.g., "We earn a small commission if you purchase through this link. It keeps Grounded Living ad-light.").
3. **Footer reminder** within long-form buyer’s guides referencing the full [Disclosure](/disclosure) page.

## Tracking & Measurement

- Tag outbound links with `?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=<post-slug>`.
- Monitor CTR in Plausible and partner dashboards; target ≥ 2% per module.
- Log revenue milestones in the marketing dashboard; first goal is $100 within 90 days.

## Content Roadmap

Create or refresh the following posts with affiliate context:

1. **Toolkit for Slow Living** – hero roundup linking to all partner categories.
2. **Herbalist’s Winter Cabinet** – align with the new cold-season PDF.
3. **Breakfast Tools I Actually Use** – integrate Our Place, blender, storage containers.
4. **Supplements with Real Science** – focus on practitioner-grade options.
5. **Calm Lighting Guide** – include circadian-friendly bulbs and salt lamps.
6. **Weekly Meal Prep Flow** – highlight Thrive Market pantry bundles.

Each post should open with reader pain points, outline evaluation criteria, and close with the inline newsletter CTA so visitors join the list after engaging with commerce content.
