## Keyword Strategy Framework
1. **Primary keyword per post** sourced from long-tail targets above (KD ≤35, SV 50–1,000).

3. **FAQ targeting:** Capture question keywords (e.g., "Is fire cider safe during pregnancy?") answered with citations.
4. **Internal link map:** Each post links to:
   - Cornerstone guide overview page.
   - 2 sibling posts in the same cluster.
   - 1 post from another pillar for cross-pollination (e.g., recipe linking to lifestyle bedtime ritual).
5. **Conversion focus:** Every post aligns with a tailored lead magnet (immune meal plan, herbal starters guide, seasonal reset workbook).

## Post Structure Standards
1. **SEO Metadata:** Provide `seo_title`, `seo_description`, and `excerpt` fields (≤ 160 characters) with the primary keyword near the front.
2. **Opening Hook:** 2–3 sentences introducing the benefit and personal angle; include the primary keyword.
3. **Featured Media:** One landscape hero image (1200×630) with descriptive alt text referencing the recipe/remedy; one vertical image (1000×1500) optimized for Pinterest.
4. **Ingredients / Materials:** Bullet or table format with measurements + sourcing notes; link to shop page or affiliate only when ethical.
5. **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Numbered steps with sensory cues, timing, and doneness markers; include printable card component (see Recipe Card spec) with schema.
6. **Nutrition & Safety Notes:** Highlight macros, allergen swaps, contraindications; cite registered dietitian or clinical herbalist sources.
7. **Evidence-Anchored Insights:** For each health claim, cite at least one reputable source and briefly summarize findings in natural language.
8. **FAQs:** Minimum of 3 questions using long-tail queries; answer concisely with citations.
9. **Internal Links & CTAs:** Add in-line links and "You may also love" related posts block; close with newsletter CTA tailored to topic.
10. **Schema Requirements:** Recipes use `Recipe` schema; remedies and lifestyle posts use `HowTo` or `Article` schema with `citation` and `author` fields populated.

## Related Posts Component Guidelines
