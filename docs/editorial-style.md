# Editorial style guide

Grounded Living stories blend evidence-backed wellness insights with a calm, invitational tone. Use this guide when drafting
new pieces or editing existing ones so every article feels consistent and purposeful.

## Heading hierarchy

- Always start with a single H1 in Contentful; the template renders it as the on-page title.
- Use H2 elements to group major ideas, followed by H3 for supporting detail. Avoid skipping levels (e.g., never jump from H2 to
  H4).
- Keep headings short (4–8 words) and action oriented—clarity beats cleverness for skim readers and search snippets.

## Paragraph rhythm

- Aim for paragraphs of 2–4 sentences. Break up longer thoughts with subheadings, bullets, or pull quotes to maintain readability
  on mobile.
- Lead with the key takeaway, then layer supporting context or research. Readers should grasp the value of a section within the
  first sentence.
- Use plain language wherever possible. If you introduce a clinical term, follow it with a quick definition or relatable example.

## Images & captions

- Pair each hero or inline image with a descriptive caption that adds context—why it matters, what to notice, or how it supports
  the takeaway.
- Keep captions to one sentence and avoid repeating information already covered in the surrounding paragraph.
- When citing data or third-party research in a graphic, include the source in the caption (e.g., “Source: Journal of
  Chronobiology, 2023”).

## Linking philosophy

- Follow the “link three ways” rule:
  - **Up:** Reference the pillar page that anchors the topic (e.g., Circadian Rhythm hub) to reinforce topical authority.
  - **Sideways:** Link to one or two sibling posts that help readers continue their journey without returning to the index.
  - **Out:** Cite at least one credible external source (study, expert interview, or reputable publication) to ground claims.
- The CMS automatically links the first occurrence of select pillar phrases via the internal link map. Review those suggestions
  during editing and add manual links where they strengthen the narrative.
- If an article relies on a highly curated narrative—such as a personal essay—you can toggle `disableAutoLinks` in Contentful to
  opt out of automated linking for that post.

## Voice & tone quick checks

- Write in second person when giving actionable guidance (“Try dimming overhead lights…”).
- Use present tense for evergreen rituals and future tense when describing upcoming benefits or programs.
- Avoid fear-based hooks; instead invite curiosity and small, achievable experiments that build reader trust.
