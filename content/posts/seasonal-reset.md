Transitioning between seasons can stir up our nervous system. Instead of forcing a dramatic detox, try a gentle reset that
centers your body and mind.

## Day 1: Clear Space Intentionally

Light a candle, turn on a favorite playlist, and spend 15 minutes refreshing one corner of your home. Focus on textures and
scents that make you exhale deeper.

## Day 3: Nourish with Warmth

Prepare a pot of mineral-rich broth or herbal tea. Sip slowly while you journal about the feelings the season is bringing
forward for you.

## Day 5: Move with Gratitude

Stretch, dance, or walk barefoot if the weather allows. Match each movement with a statement of gratitude for your body.

## Day 7: Integrate

Close your week by writing a letter to your future self about the rituals you want to carry forward. Seal it with an
intention and revisit it when the next season arrives.
