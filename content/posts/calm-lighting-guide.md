Lighting dictates our nervous system cues. Swap harsh bulbs for calming alternatives to support melatonin production and a grounded evening routine.

## Swap to circadian-supportive bulbs

Install [GE Cync Reveal bulbs](https://example.com/reveal-bulb?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=calm-lighting) in bedside lamps for warm evening light, then schedule a cooler spectrum for mornings. Their app-based dimming makes transitions effortless.

## Layer lamps with soft diffusion

Pair a [Himalayan salt lamp](https://example.com/salt-lamp?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=calm-lighting) with your meditation corner to disperse amber light, and keep an [IKEA linen lantern](https://example.com/linen-lantern?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=calm-lighting) in the living room for a gentle glow while reading.

## Ritualize digital sunsets

Use [Flux screen filters](https://example.com/flux?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=calm-lighting) on laptops and schedule the [Hatch Restore 2](https://example.com/hatch-restore?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=calm-lighting) to begin a sound bath one hour before bed. Combine this with our Evening Ritual Checklist to reinforce consistent cues.
