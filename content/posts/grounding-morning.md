A slow, sensory-rich morning ritual can transform your day. This five-minute sequence brings you back to your body before
the notifications start buzzing.

## Step 1: Arrival Breath

Place one hand on your belly and one on your heart. Take three deep breaths, inhaling for four counts and exhaling for six.

## Step 2: Warm Beverage Meditation

Prepare a mug of warm lemon water, tea, or coffee. Wrap your hands around it and notice the aroma before your first sip.

## Step 3: Intention Whisper

Whisper a gentle intention for your day. Keep it short, affirmative, and emotionally resonant. Let it guide your choices as
you move through your schedule. If you need a journal prompt, this [guided gratitude notebook](https://example.com/gratitude-journal)
is a beautiful companion.
