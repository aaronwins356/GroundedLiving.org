Supplements should do more than fill a shelfâ€”they must address documented deficiencies and complement lifestyle interventions. These picks are practitioner-approved and available through our Fullscript dispensary.

## Foundational nutrients

If lab work shows a gap, consider [Fullscript magnesium glycinate](https://example.com/magnesium?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=supplements-science) for nervous system regulation and [methylated B-complex](https://example.com/b-complex?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=supplements-science) to support energy metabolism. Share results with your healthcare provider before starting any protocol.

## Targeted adaptogens

On high-stress weeks, [Apothekary Chill The F Out](https://example.com/chill-out?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=supplements-science) blends ashwagandha and reishi in clinically relevant doses. We also rely on [Four Sigmatic focus blend](https://example.com/focus-blend?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=supplements-science) to pair with morning journaling.

## Sleep support

For gentle sleep hygiene, [beam dream powder](https://example.com/beam-dream?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=supplements-science) combines L-theanine and nano CBD. Use it alongside blue-light-blocking rituals and our Evening Ritual Checklist for best results.
