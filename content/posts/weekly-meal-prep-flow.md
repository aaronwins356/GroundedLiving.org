A gentle meal prep routine keeps weekday decisions light. This flow takes under two hours and leans on pantry partners we trust.

## Gather staples in one delivery

Order a [Thrive Market pantry bundle](https://example.com/thrive-bundle?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=meal-prep-flow) with grains, legumes, and nut milks so you start stocked. Keep [OXO pop containers](https://example.com/oxo-pop?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=meal-prep-flow) labeled for quick scoops and inventory checks.

## Batch cook in stages

Use the [Our Place Perfect Pot](https://example.com/perfect-pot?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=meal-prep-flow) for soups while roasting veggies on [USA Pan sheet pans](https://example.com/usa-pan?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=meal-prep-flow). Rotate items into cooling racks so textures stay crisp.

## Portion and store mindfully

Divide meals into [W&P porter bowls](https://example.com/porter-bowls?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=meal-prep-flow) and log leftovers in a simple note or Notion template. Add a reminder to thaw breakfast bakes the night before so mornings stay easy.
